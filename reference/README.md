# Reference material for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This folder contains a focused collection of books that directly discuss or significantly support the understanding and application of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

## Purpose
To provide a reading list that centers exclusively on Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, combining information retrieval techniques with generative models.

## Recommended Books
These titles either directly address RAG or offer deep insight into the retrieval and generation components critical to building RAG systems:

- *Natural Language Processing for Information Retrieval* – Offers foundational understanding of retrieval systems used in RAG.
- *Text Retrieval and Search Engines* – Covers core algorithms and architectures behind document indexing and querying.
- *Hybrid Search and Language Models* (industry publication or report-based texts) – Practical applications of combining search and generation.
- *Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems: Design and Evaluation* (if available or to be added from niche publishers or thesis projects)


## Contributions
You're welcome to:
- Suggest new RAG-specific books or publications
- Share summaries or annotated chapters
- Link to public datasets or case studies mentioned in the books

Let’s create a concise, high-value reading hub for mastering RAG!
